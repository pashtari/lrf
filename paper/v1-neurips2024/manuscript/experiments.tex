\section{Experiments} \label{sec: experiments}

In this section, the proposed IMF compression algorithm is assessed against baseline codecs following the implementation details, described in Appendix \ref{app: implementation details}. Moreover, ablation studies are presented to investigate the effect of different parameters in IMF.

\subsection{Rate-Distortion Performance} \label{sec: rate_distortion_performance}

Figure \ref{fig: rate-distortion kodak} shows the rate-distortion curves for IMF, SVD, and JPEG on the Kodak dataset. We also performed experiments on the CLIC dataset, with the results provided in Appendix \ref{app: clic}. For each method, PSNR and SSIM values are averaged over all images at different bit rates up to 0.5 bits per pixel (bpp). 

As seen in Figure \ref{fig: rate-distortion kodak}, our IMF method consistently outperforms JPEG at low bit rates under 0.25 bpp and remains competitive with JPEG at higher bit rates in terms of both PSNR and SSIM. It is also evident that IMF significantly outperforms the SVD-based method at all the bit rates. This can be attributed to the quantization errors that SVD is sensitive to during encoding and decoding, which deteriorate its performance. In contrast, the quantization-free property of IMF effectively guarantees higher performance at different bpp values.

\subsection{Qualitative Performance}

The qualitative results on the Kodak dataset are presented in Figure \ref{fig: qualitative comparison}. We visualize two example images compressed by each of the baseline methods at nearly the same bit rate. As visible in both examples, IMF is capable of maintaining higher-quality compression, while SVD yields more blurred images, and JPEG produces color artifacts, in the regions marked by red bounding boxes.

\subsection{ImageNet Classification Performance} \label{sec: imagenet Classification Performance}

As another criterion, we investigate the performance of an image classifier on the images compressed by different compression algorithms. This criterion focuses on the capability of different compression methods to preserve the visual semantic information in each image. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of image compression where various vision tasks such as classification---rather than maintaining the perceived image quality---are the main objective, while keeping the requirement of resources such as memory, communication bandwidth, computation power, latency budget, etc. as limited as possible. ImageNet \cite{deng2009imagenet} validation set, containing 50000 images with a resolution of $224 \times 224$ in 1000 classes, is considered in this classification task done by a ResNet-50 classifier \cite{he2016deep}, pre-trained on the original ImageNet dataset. The classification performance comparison is made in Figure \ref{fig: imagenet_classification}. The results suggest that IMF leads to more than a 10\% improvement in top-1 accuracy over JPEG at low bit rates under 0.23 bpp and reaches a top-5 accuracy of nearly 80\% at a bit rate of 0.25 bpp.

\subsection{Ablation Studies} \label{sec: ablation studies}

In this section, ablation studies are performed, focusing on factor bounds and BCD iteration numbers in the proposed IMF compression algorithm and their effect on its performance. The other ablation studies are postponed to the appendix.

\paragraph{Factor bounds.} 
Figure \ref{fig: bounds ablation psnr-vs-bpp} studies the compression performance of IMF with different factor bounds $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in Algorithm \ref{alg: bcd for imf}. According to the results, the bounds $\alpha=-16$ and $\beta=15$ lead to the best performance. Limiting factor elements within these bounds leads to dedicating fewer bits to represent the resulting narrower range, compared to the other bounds, and consequently higher compression rates without sacrificing performance. 

\paragraph{BCD iteration.}
The next parameter to study is the maximum iteration number specified for the BCD updates of IMF in Algorithm \eqref{alg: bcd for imf}. 
According to the numerical results on various datasets, the IMF performance jumps significantly after 2 iterations, while more iteration numbers lead to marginal improvement. 
This observation is shown for Kodak in Figure \ref{fig: iteration ablation psnr-vs-bpp}.
This feature makes IMF computationally efficient since with a limited number of BCD iterations a high compression performance can be achieved.
