Image compression is essential for efficient transmission and storage.The most widely used transform coders, such as the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and singular value decomposition (SVD), represent image data in continuous domains, necessitating carefully designed quantizers. Notably, the performance of SVD-based methods is more sensitive to quantization errors than that of DCT-based methods like JPEG. Therefore, we introduce a variant of integer matrix factorization (IMF) to develop a novel quantization-free image compression method. IMF provides a low-rank representation of the image data as a product of two smaller factor matrices with bounded integer elements, thereby eliminating the need for quantization. We propose an efficient, provably convergent iterative algorithm for IMF using a block coordinate descent (BCD) scheme, with subproblems having closed-form solutions. The experiments demonstrate that our IMF-based compression method outperforms JPEG, achieving improvements of over 3 dB in PSNR at rates of under 0.17 bits per pixel (bpp) on the Kodak dataset. We also assessed our method's capability to preserve visual semantic information by evaluating an ImageNet pre-trained classifier on compressed images. Remarkably, our method resulted in an improvement of over 10\% in top-1 accuracy compared to JPEG at rates under 0.23 bpp.
