\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This work presents a novel quantization-free lossy image compression method based on integer matrix factorization (IMF). By representing image data as a product of two smaller matrices with bounded integer elements, the proposed IMF approach effectively eliminates the need for quantization, a significant source of error in traditional compression methods like JPEG and SVD. The reshaped factor matrices are compatible with existing lossless compression standards, enhancing the overall efficiency and flexibility of the \remove{system}\revise{method}. Our proposed iterative algorithm, utilizing a block coordinate descent scheme, has proven to be both efficient and convergent. Experimental results demonstrate that the IMF method significantly outperforms JPEG in terms of PSNR and SIMM at low bit rates and maintains better visual semantic information. This advantage underscores the potential of IMF to set a new standard in lossy image compression, bridging the gap between factorization and quantization.

\remove{A limitation of IMF lies in its inability to control the entropy of the elements in the factor matrices, which could enhance the performance of the subsequent entropy-based lossless coder. We plan to address this in the future by incorporating entropy-aware regularization into the current IMF objective function.}
